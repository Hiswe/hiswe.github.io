## Introduction

If you want to handle a SQL Database in [NodeJS](https://nodejs.org/en/), you may want to use [Sequelize](http://docs.sequelizejs.com/).  

It's a nice ORM with a promise based API that makes it easy to:

- define models
- define relations between those models
- retrieve those relations when accessing an instance.

But I find it hard to handle `COUNT` and `SUM` functions inside instances.  
I'm not really into writing `SQL` queries by ownâ€¦ 

And it's where [squel](https://hiddentao.com/squel/) can helps us!
