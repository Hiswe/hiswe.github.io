## Introduction

You're ready to make your new application.
You take [Vue 2](https://vuejs.org/) as your framework

But you want your application to be:

- fast
- bulletproof

So you decide to make a {% post_link 12-vue-with-nuxt Universal Web Application %} with [Nuxt 2](https://nuxtjs.org/) & [Koa 2](https://koajs.com/)
It will:

- fasten the first rendering
- be able to run without JS activated on the client side

<!-- more -->

**Notes:**

- You will need to be familiar with Koa/Nuxt.
- Be aware that both Nuxt and Koa use the concepts of `context (ctx)` & `middleware`.
  I've tried to differentiate them as much as I could in the following post, but if you're confused reread carefully and try to sort it out ðŸ˜…
- You can find a working example of what I'm talking next in the [koa-nuxt-example repository](https://github.com/Hiswe/koa-nuxt-example)

## Shaped for express

Because [express.js](https://expressjs.com/) is the most commonly used Node.js server framework, most of the UWA frameworks `render function` are shaped for it.

This means that in express, [Nuxt integration came out of the box](https://github.com/nuxt/create-nuxt-app/blob/master/template/server/index-express.js).
You just need to call it like any express middleware:

{% include_code lang:js 13-koa-nuxt/01-express-middleware.js %}

Since we wants to use Koa, we will need to make our own middleware.
No need to think a lot about integration since this has already been solved but the [nuxt community](https://github.com/nuxt/create-nuxt-app/blob/master/template/server/index-koa.js)

{% include_code lang:js 13-koa-nuxt/02-koa-middleware.js %}

This will work perfectly if you're only interested in server rendering.

## Handling POST

Since one of our goal is to be able to work without JS on the client side, we'll need to add more code.
Let say we want to be able to post a form.

- First we will use [koa-router](https://www.npmjs.com/package/koa-router) and [koa-body](https://www.npmjs.com/package/koa-body)
- Then with those we will able to handle our `POST` action
- And we might want to do a database call inside it (`doSomethingAsync` in the example)

{% include_code lang:js 13-koa-nuxt/03-koa-form.js %}

This is kind of ok:

- we can now post some data without JS activated
- redirect to `/` where Nuxt will handle the markup

_We should write an error middleware_ to be sure that if something went wrong, this will not crash our application

{% include_code lang:js 13-koa-nuxt/04-koa-form-error.js %}

This will work but it's a bit rough: we should send back some data validation to the user form.

## Handling Server data in Nuxt

In order to display any validation in the Nuxt application we will need to:

- persist data between our post route and the redirection
- pass those data down to the Nuxt application
- do something with it

### Koa-session

The most common way to handle data between routes is with sessions.
We'll use [koa-session](https://www.npmjs.com/package/koa-session) for this.

The [installation guide](https://www.npmjs.com/package/koa-session#example) is pretty self explanatory.
This will add a `ctx.session` object where we can pass any kind of information.

Here is the different steps we have to make:

- Validate our form
- Add the validation to the session
- Pass it to Nuxt
  - Because Nuxt doesn't use the Koa `ctx` but use `req` & `res`, copy our session information into those objects.
  - This will be done in a Koa middleware just before the nuxt-rendering middleware
- Integrate it in the Nuxt application by either using:
  - a [Nuxt middleware](https://nuxtjs.org/guide/routing#middleware)
  - the [nuxtServerInit](https://nuxtjs.org/guide/vuex-store#the-nuxtserverinit-action) for Vuex integration
    The example will use this.
- Do what we want in our Vue components with those

{% include_code lang:js 13-koa-nuxt/05-validation.js %}

In the _store/index.js_

{% include_code lang:js 13-koa-nuxt/06-vuex-store.js %}

And that's it, we now have a store updated with our server validation.
Use [the mapState helper](https://vuex.vuejs.org/guide/state.html#the-mapstate-helper) in our Vue component to access it.

### Can't set headers after they are sent

Right now, we set the validation on our POST route, and never update it again.
This means that if the user reload the form, _the application will still display the last validation result._
This isn't right, we should clear this once displayed.

This should be easy by updating our Koa middleware that link our session to nuxt.

{% include_code lang:js 13-koa-nuxt/07-naive-validation-clearing.js %}

**But this won't work**

You'll find in the server logs a `Can't set headers after they are sent`.
The problem comes from the `nuxtMiddleware` & how it bypasses the regular Koa flow.

Usually we set a `ctx.body` and all the previous middleware will continue their work.

{% caption regular flow %}
{% asset_img regular-flow.svg 500 400 "regular koa flow 'regular koa flow'" %}
{% endcaption %}

But that's what happen here

{% caption koa-nuxt flow %}
{% asset_img nuxt-flow.svg 555 400 "koa-nuxt flow 'koa-nuxt flow'" %}
{% endcaption %}

To fix that we need to make sure that our headers are set before the Nuxt middleware.

### autoCommit: false to the rescue

Koa-session lets us send the headers manually with [the manuallyCommit() method](https://www.npmjs.com/package/koa-session#sessionmanuallycommit)

So we have to refactor our code like this:

{% include_code lang:js 13-koa-nuxt/08-manually-commit.js %}

This will solve our problem. The main issue there is that we have to remember calling `manuallyCommit()` every time we update the session

## Displaying all errors with Nuxt

There is one last thing we have to handle.
Right now our `handleError` middleware will make Koa show the error.
But in Nuxt we can have an [error layout](https://nuxtjs.org/guide/views#error-page) and we should take advantage of it.

To do this we'll need to:

- set the error to the `ctx.req` object (Nuxt still only work with `req` & `res`)
- call Nuxt to render the page inside our `handleError` middleware
- [write a Nuxt middleware](https://nuxtjs.org/guide/routing#middleware) that will render the error page by calling [nuxtContex.error](https://nuxtjs.org/api/context)

{% include_code lang:js 13-koa-nuxt/09-koa-nuxt-error.js %}

In a `middleware/handle-server-errors.js` file. (don't forget to reference it in your `nuxt.config.js`)

{% include_code lang:js 13-koa-nuxt/10-nuxt-error-middleware.js %}

## Conclusion

Making Nuxt working with Koa isn't as smooth as with Express.
Still I prefer {% post_link 07-from-express-to-koa working with Koa %}, and with a little more boilerplate everything's fine.

I'm sure there is room for improvements, but it's working for me.
The downside is mainly more boilerplate code and handling session updates manually.

- if you just want some basic server rendering everything will stay simple
- if you don't want to support any kind of session everything will stay simple
- supporting `asynchronous code` should be easy
  - Koa is build around that
  - [nuxtServerInit](https://nuxtjs.org/guide/vuex-store#the-nuxtserverinit-action) supports [async function](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Statements/async_function)
  - the same goes for [nuxt middleware](https://nuxtjs.org/guide/routing#middleware)
- in Koa you can differentiate a `no-js` client environment from an AJAX environment by checking the `ctx.request.type === 'application/json'`

Nuxt is a very smart piece of software, and can really handle every use case we have in the server environment!

As a side note I've extract the `nuxtMiddleware` in a [npm package](https://www.npmjs.com/package/@hiswe/koa-nuxt)
â€¦and as said before you can find a full example [here](https://github.com/Hiswe/koa-nuxt-example)
