## Introduction

As seen in {% post_link 06-html-basic-part-3 %} the HTML file is our web-page content.  
But right now it looks pretty ugly.

So now it's time to make this a little bit beautiful.

## What's CSS?

<!-- an image of a drawing of a rainbow waterfall -->

[CSS](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cascading_Style_Sheets) stands for:

- **C**ascading
- **S**tyle
- **S**heets

It's a language that let you specify how your browser will display the HTML content.

Each word has a very specific meaning that will describe on the following posts.
But right now we will focus on the "style" part.

## Style

<!-- a fashion elements -->

So we've seen how to use [attributes](http://localhost:7000/2018/05-html-basic-part-2/#The-anatomy-of-attributes) in HTML elements.

And guess what? **there is a style attribute!**

So let use that to make our page nicer:

- color our title
- color and make bigger the author's name like so it can pop out more
- add a border to our image, so it can stands out
- make the `“wolf”` shout more compelling by coloring the background and make the text bigger
