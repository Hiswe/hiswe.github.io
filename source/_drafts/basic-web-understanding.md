## Introduction

The purpose of this post is to have a basic understanding of how, when you type an address, you can see a website.  
It's a simplification of what happens in reality, but the main ideas are here ðŸ™‚

## Basic vocabulary 

### Internet 

It's a way of making *devices talking to each other*. 

### Many devices

Even if it's all computers we can differentiate two types of devices:

#### The client

{% caption clients: your everyday devices! %}
{% asset_img computer-and-phone.svg 350 200 a computer & a phone %} 
{% endcaption %}

It's *your device* (laptop or smartphoneâ€¦).

It has one or many *browsers installed on it* to access easily the internet.

#### The server

{% caption server: the ones always there to help you! (they never sleep ðŸ˜¶) %}
{% asset_img server.svg 220 160 a server %} 
{% endcaption %}

It's a *computer* specialized in *answering request*. 
It has some special software running on it to behave that way.
Usually you don't own one.

On a small note, Internet is about making computers talk to each other. 
So you can transform your own computer in a server if you want by installing those specific softwares!

### The Browser

A [browser](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Web_browser): It's the software you use to access an internet page.
Some common browsers are:
- [Google Chrome](https://www.google.com/chrome/browser/desktop/index.html)
- [Firefox](https://www.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/new/)
- [Microsoft Edge](https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/microsoft-edge)
- [Apple Safari](https://support.apple.com/downloads/safari)

It will do a lot for you so you can have a graphical representation of what you're asking for.  
Yep it seems obvious but that's the main thing of computer: how with [bits](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bit) you can have an interactive display âœ¨ 

## How does it works
