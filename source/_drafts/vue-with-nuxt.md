## Introduction

[Vue.js](https://vuejs.org/) is a very pleasant framework.
To begin with it we have many easy solutions:

- [Vue CLI 3](https://cli.vuejs.org/) üõ†Ô∏è Standard Tooling for Vue.js Development
  The official solution to setup quickly a vue application.
- [ParcelJs](https://parceljs.org/) the Blazing fast, zero configuration web application bundler
  You can read {% post_link 11-parcel-with-vue in this post %} my own experience with it.
- [Nuxt](https://nuxtjs.org/) Universal Vue.js Applications

But which solution to choose?

**`[TL;DR]`** go with nuxt if you like:

- an easy setup
- [Convention over configuration](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Convention_over_configuration)
- keeping the ability to move from a [Single-page application](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Single-page_application) to a Universal Web application
