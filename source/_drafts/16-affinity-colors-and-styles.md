## Introduction

This article will talk about colors & styles styles in Affinity Designer.  
It should help you to define/reuse your colors, make gradients & palets and maybe more

Yet again, if you don't know anything about Vector drawings you can look into:

- {% post_link 01-vector-basics %}: explain what is a `vector` drawing
- {% post_link 02-vector-creation-basics %}: and some basic vector software usage

## Stroke & Fills reminder

When you style any shape in the vector world, you have to main concerns:

- the `stroke` it's what is ON your path. It has a size and a color.
  - with a size of `0` no stroke will appear
  - and same thing with a transparent stroke
- the `fill`
  - it's what's inside your shape
  - It can be any color!

## Mr Patate

As a example we will try to do a french Mr Patate ðŸ‡«ðŸ‡·ðŸ¥” (but no cheese, no wine & no baguette)

The outline will be simple as that:

{% caption Bonjour, le pas la France %}
{% asset_img wireframe.svg 450 450 "the vector drawing with some parts missing 'the vector drawing with some parts missing'" %}
{% endcaption %}

## The color palette

This is where you can adjust both your stroke & fill colors.

- Like in any design software a lot of options are hidden behind some click & menus.
- It's done usually to not clutter the interface  with all the options at onceâ€¦
- â€¦while keeping everything quite accessible

{% caption A lot of stuff just under your fingertips %}
{% asset_img color-palette.svg 680 530 "the affinity color panel interface with annotations 'the affinity color panel interface with annotations'" %}
{% endcaption %}

So you can:

- edit fill & stroke colors
- permute them
- change the transparency
- see different kind of color representations
- add some noise to your color
- _pick colors_ (**this is tricky**)  
  - Drag & drop the color picker anywhere in the canvas  
  - Choose the color
  - Apply it to the fill or stroke by clicking on the color of the color picker

And by double clicking on a stroke or fill you can open a full color chooser:

{% caption If you're into numbers %}
{% asset_img color-chooser.png 500 342 "Affinity color chooser 'Affinity color chooser'" %}
{% endcaption %}


And this is how handy it is to use!
